### Linux terminal commands

Below, I am going to show a table with 5 very basic examples of Linux terminal commands that I have learned throughout my years as a web developer:

| Command           | Description                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| cd *directory*    | Change to directory *directory* |
| date              | Show system date                |
| ls                | List files in current directory |
| mkdir *directory* | Make directory *directory*      |
| pwd               | Show current directory          |

### Bahs aliases for Linux

Here I am going to show some examples of Linux aliases that I personally find useful when working with the terminal:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
Alias
</th>
<th>
Description
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>

```console
alias apt-sysupdate="sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y"
```

</td>
<td>
This is alias updates all the packages of the system
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```console
alias search="grep"
```

</td>
<td>
This is alias is used to search text and strings in a given file
</td>
</tr>
</table>
